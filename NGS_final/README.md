This folder contains the RMarkdown file, MultiQC report, and execution report for my next generation sequencing course final. 
The goal was to perform differential gene expression analysis on RNA-seq data generated by Jiao et al. in this paper (doi:
10.1261/rna.069773.118). This was done by utilizing BASH shell scripting as indicated and R to execute the Salmon+tximport+DESeq2 
pipeline. The final report includes an analysis of the results.
